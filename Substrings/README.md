## The Odin Project - Ruby Programming 
### Project: Substrings 

Developed a method that takes a word as the first argument and a dictionary array as the second, returning a hash listing each substring that is found in the original string and the number of times it occurs. 

This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/sub-strings?ref=lnav).


## Summary 
* Utilized nesting loops with the **each** method to iterate through the arrays and compare the contents.
