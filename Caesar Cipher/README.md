## The Odin Project - Ruby Programming 
### Project: Caesar Cipher 

Created a Caesar Cipher - an encryptor that substitutes each letter by some fixed number of positions down the alphabet - in Ruby

This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/caesar-cipher?ref=lnav).


## Summary 
* To ensure the encoder wraps from z to a and back, created two hashes of the uppercase and lowercase alphabets which then rotated the user input's amount of places. 
* Mapped through the string to find the corrosponding key to the cipher
* Printed and joined the resulting code
* Works with positive and negative integers.
