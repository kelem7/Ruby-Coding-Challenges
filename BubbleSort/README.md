## The Odin Project - Ruby Programming 
### Project: Bubble Sort 

Created function that sorts an array using bubble sort metholdology without using the sort method.  

This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/bubble-sort).


## Summary 
* Utilized a **while loop** to loop through the array until all numbers are sorted.
* Looped through the array with **each_with_index** to compare the values before swapping them.
